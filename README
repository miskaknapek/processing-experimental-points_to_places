Points to places
...a little science pendulum/spring play...

[ usage:
press somewhere on screen to restart the circle locations.
check the Processing file for more extensive explanations
of the keyboard commands.
quick tip: try the following keys:
1,2,3,s,S,alt,up,down,left,right  ]

a little Processing sketch where
there are some circles that are attached
to points (the destination points here),
by an elastic 'string'.
initially there's no drag or resistance,
so the circles move around the destination 
points like a perpetual pendulum.

also initially the size of the circle is
a reflection of their velocity.
the faster they move, the larger they
become.
